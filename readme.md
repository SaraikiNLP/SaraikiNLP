## Introduction

**SaraikiNLP** is the world's first and fundamental **Python framework** for **Saraiki language research**. It comes with **basic NLP functions** to help researchers, students, and anyone interested in Saraiki NLP work.


---

## Why Saraiki?

### About the Saraiki Language

**Saraiki (skr)** is an **Indo-Aryan** language spoken by over 25â€“30 million people, primarily in Pakistan. It is spoken in **Southern Punjab** in cities like **Multan**, **Bahawalpur**, **Dera Ghazi Khan**, and **Rahim Yar Khan**, and extends into parts of **Sindh**, **Balochistan**, and **Khyber Pakhtunkhwa**. Despite its rich linguistic and cultural heritage, Saraiki remains underrepresented in NLP and computational research.

### Why Should One Work on Saraiki NLP?

Despite having millions of speakers, Saraiki still lacks digital resources, computational tools, and NLP support. Major challenges include:

- **Limited Text Datasets** â€“ Few machine-readable corpora are available.
- **Minimal NLP Research** â€“ There is less work on tokenization, lemmatization, named entity recognition (NER), or speech recognition.
- **No Official Status** â€“ Unlike Urdu or Punjabi, Saraiki lacks mainstream software support in AI and ML applications.

### The Goal of SaraikiNLP

The **SaraikiNLP project** aims to:

- **Developing Core NLP Tools** â€“ Implement normalization, tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, and NER models.
- **Promote Saraiki Research** â€“ Increase awareness and support for research in this low resource language.

---

## Intended Audience

- **Science/Research:** For researchers and linguists experimenting with Saraiki language data.
- **Developers:** To help build Saraiki applications with less effort.
- **Education:** Providing resources and tools for students interested in Saraiki language research.
